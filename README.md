#Knowledge Graph
A powerful Python-based system to detect sentence boundaries in unstructured text using a Word Graph-based approach enhanced with entropy measures from the Byte Latent Tokenizer (BLT). The model processes textual data, builds a graph representation of word transitions, and uses entropy analysis to identify potential sentence boundariesâ€”useful for unsupervised NLP tasks like text segmentation or summarization.
